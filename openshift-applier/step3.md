Before we can run this, we need to create a playbook which will call the OpenShift-Applier.

```
cat <<EOM >apply.yml
---
- name: Deploy {{ target }} 
  hosts: "{{ target }}"
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: openshift-applier/roles/openshift-applier
EOM
```{{execute}}

You can see this `{{ target }}` variable being called here. It's purpose is to allow you to run specific portions of the inventory if you want.
